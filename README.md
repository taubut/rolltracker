# rolltracker
Addon for WoW Classic to track a characters /roll history
This addon currently tracks:
/roll
/roll 1-98
/roll 1-99
/roll 1-100

It colors rolls based on the number:
25-0 | Red
26-74 | Yellow
75-100 | Green

The frame can be moved around just by dragging it and the clear history button will clear everything.

This is character specific, so each character will show a different history.

Both /rh and /rollhistory bring up the history window.
